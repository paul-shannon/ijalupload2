# MorphemeGloss.py: a class to capture, and render into HTML, the morphemes of the spoken text, using
# standard grammatical terms
#
# see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_glossing_abbreviations
# from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlinear_gloss#Structure
#
#  grammatical terms are commonly abbreviated and printed in SMALL CAPITALS to keep them distinct
#  from translations,  especially when they are frequent or important for analysis.
#
# also see the Leipzig Glossing Rules: https://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/resources/glossing-rules.php
#
# in interlienar morphological glosses, punctuation separate the glosses:
#
#        .  equivalent to a space (separating words) in the morpheme line
#        -  or _ when a source language word corresponds to a phrase in the glossing language
#        =  separates clitics (a morpheme with syntactic characteristics of a word, but which
#           depends phonologically upon another word or phrase)
#        ~  reduplication
#        - and more...

# david beck (email 12 aug 2018):
#
#    I usually leave the numbers in the abbreviations in normal font size, as well as punctuation
#    marks like the colon and the period (which are reserved characters for interlinear glossing). The
#    morpheme delimiters are also in regular sized type, and in the original GUI there was a field
#    where the user could list the symbols in use. – (n-dash), =, and • are the most common, but there
#    are others people are likely to use such as ~ (for reduplication), ^ (to add a floating tone to a
#    morph), and < > (for infixes). Another thing that we haven’t come up against yet is that there are
#    sometimes subscripts, most commonly used to label something as belonging to a particular class.
